## Course Units
This course has seven units. Each unit is a basic primer on a set of business concepts that are essential to running a creative practice. 

1. [Building Blocks](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_F19/wiki/Unit-1:-Building-Blocks)

  *Topics Covered: Business structures and formation; agency and representation; employment*

  The starting point for every business: who are you and how do you work with others? We'll start with a primer on basic business structures, from sole proprietorships to corporations—examining the benefits and drawbacks of each. The main focus of the unit will be on agency and employment—how do we define our relationships with the people we work with?

2. [Property](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_F19/wiki/Unit-2:-Intellectual-Property)

  As creative practitioners, we all actively engage in the act of creating, sharing, borrowing and—in some cases—stealing intellectual property. The goal of this unit is to help you understand what intellectual property is, how you can protect it, and how to ethically use and share it.

3. [Agreements](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_F19/wiki/Unit-3:-Legal-Agreements)
  Get it in writing! This unit is all about how we make agreements concrete and legally enforceable. We'll start with the standards of legal agreements and then delve into contracts, best practices, negotiation, enforcement and litigation.

4. [Generating Income](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_F19/wiki/Unit-4:-Generating-Income)
  How do we make that money? In this unit, we'll look at the primary methods for creating income for your business. The unit will start with an overview of basic financial concepts, followed by primers on fundraising and earning an income, and capping off with best practices for budget development and proposal writing.

5. [Managing Finances](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_F19/wiki/Unit-5:-Managing-Finances)
  Now that you have that money, what do you do with it? Successful businesses don't just do well at bringing in funds, they also do well at managing it. In this unit we'll cover the basic concepts of accounting, financial management, and taxes. Understanding the importance of these concepts will lead you to financial stability.

6. [Communication Skills](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_F19/wiki/Unit-6:-Communication-Skills)  
  Going viral ain't common and it ain't easy. So how do we get our names out there? During this unit, we'll discuss the basics of building a marketing plan, how to work with media, networking and presentation skills.

7. [Business Models](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_F19/wiki/Unit-7:-Business-Models)
  All of the subjects covered in prior units are all essential factors in a business, but to run a successful business you will need a plan. In this unit, we'll discuss the concept of business models and business plans—essentially putting all of our units together into one cohesive strategy.
